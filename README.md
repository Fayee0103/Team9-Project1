# Investor Toolkit

This goal of this project is to present any Investor with a Toolkit, that can quickly analyze any given stock.

Charts such as Trading Volumes, Historical Price with Moving Average, Rolling Annualized Returns, Cumulative Return, Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, and Correlations with other sectors are all presented to the investor to analyze and formulate a decision.

These charts are outputted to a dashboard using panels.

A benchmark can be provided as to compare and constrast the stock with and see its correlation with one another.
Other correlations can be made to things like the 10 yr Treasury Yield, or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

The primary data source used for this project is Yahoo finance via the pandas_datareader library.

The entire project can be found in the following notebook:
