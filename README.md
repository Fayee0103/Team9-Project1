# Investor Toolkit

This goal of this project is to present any Investor with a Toolkit, that can quickly analyze any given stock.

The following charts are presented to the investor to analyze and formulate a decision:

- Trading Volumes 
- Historical Price with Moving Average 
- Rolling Annualized Returns 
- Cumulative Return
- Volatility and Sharpe Ratio 
- Correlations with Benchmark, 10 Year Treasury Yield, and Bitcoin

These charts are outputted to a dashboard using panels.

A benchmark can be provided to compare and constrast the given stock with and see its correlation with it.
Other correlations can be made to things like the 10 yr Treasury Yield, or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

The primary data source used for this project is Yahoo finance via the pandas_datareader library.

The entire project can be found in the following notebook:
